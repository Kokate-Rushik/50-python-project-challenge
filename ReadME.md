# 50 Python Projects Challenge 🚀

A high-intensity, 6-month roadmap designed to master Python through 50 hands-on projects. This journey moves from basic Command Line Interface (CLI) tools to advanced Web Scraping, GUI applications, Data Analysis, and Cloud Deployment.

> **Challenge Mantra:** *"Write every line. Document every step. Push every day."*

## 🛠 The Rules of Engagement
To ensure maximum learning and engineering discipline, I am following these five core mandates:
1. **Atomic Structure**: Every project has its own dedicated folder.
2. **Mandatory Documentation**: Every project includes a specific `README.md` file.
3. **GitHub Streak**: Daily commits to maintain a consistent public proof of work.
4. **Zero AI Policy**: No use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for code generation or debugging. Only official documentation and logic.
5. **180-Day Deadline**: Completing all 50 projects within 6 months.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview

* **Phase 1: The Basics & CLI** (Projects 1–10) - Focus on logic, loops, and file I/O.
* **Phase 2: Web Scraping & Automation** (Projects 11–20) - Focus on interacting with the web.
* **Phase 3: GUI & Web Fundamentals** (Projects 21–30) - Focus on frontend and APIs.
* **Phase 4: Intermediate Web & Data** (Projects 31–40) - Focus on databases and analysis.
* **Phase 5: Advanced & Deployment** (Projects 41–50) - Focus on ML, Docker, and Cloud.

## 💡 Motivation (Marathi)
* **Interview Mastery:** Jeva interview madhe prashna yetil, teva tu ratta marun uttar nahi denars. Tu tujhya real experience madhun bolshil je tu magchya 6 mahinyat swatach solve kela aahe.
* **Resume Game-Changer:** Imagine kar, jithe baki candidates chya resume madhe fakt 4-5 basic projects astat, tithe tujhyakade 50 projects chi purna list asel. Tujha resume bheed me alag hi chamkega.
